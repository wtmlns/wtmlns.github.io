<p>Ignoring the outcomes and observing the nature of things in general that lead to the dicovery or the birth of the current state of configs. </p>
<p> 
Theories as configs is a point of view where theories are considered as configs from a configurational standpoint. In this point of view, theories such as classical mechanics and periodic law can be considered as configs. In other words, any fact can be considered as a config, but as a rule of thumb, we want to focus on some of the most fundamental facts and the facts that are fundamental to daily life. 
</p>
  <p> 
From an evolutionary and or information theory perspective, we must have config from the beginning. If we consider, for example, the first life form that started walking on water, life must have added another config that is not water during its period of existence. We can also view the creation of a transistor as one such config being added to us to derive value from. 
</p>
  <p> 
This pattern of configs can be observed in many areas of life, including from religion to behaviors of professors in business compared to that of businessmen or spending behavior of people from different castes in India when caste was prevalent. 
</p>
  <p> 
One key aspect to realize here is that people's lives are dependent on these configs. If you propose a heliocentric universe for example, you are threatening the livelihoods of people living on the original configs and this can be detrimental to you and for them. Or a curated composition of chemical substances that act as poison to our bodies. 
</p>
  <p> 
 
In this proposition, there are multiple ways to provide life, one of which I like the most is finding or rearranging configs that provide maximum value to prosperous people. Examples of this are the birth of the internet, google, satellites, the general theory of relativity, and so on. 
 </p>
  <p> 
 
Now some configs are testable and experienced by humans through machines and configs can not be tested or experienced because of limitations of the physical body. One such attempt at configs is string theory, in which people start a concept and then try to achieve it mathematically, for which they add additional dimensions (configs to the field). Neither the theory nor the dimensions can be tested at this point. 
 </p>
  <p> 
In conclusion, I think our lives depend on these configs both on the ones we agree upon and the ones we are trying to uncover. Where we want to position ourselves in this configs landscape is up to us.
